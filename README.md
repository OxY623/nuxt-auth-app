# Nuxt 3 Authentication Demo

This project demonstrates a Nuxt 3 application with authentication, account management, and data filtering functionality.

## Technology Stack

- **Nuxt 3**: Modern Vue.js framework
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Pinia**: State management
- **Nuxt UI**: UI component library
- **SASS**: CSS preprocessor
- **Tailwind CSS**: CSS framework

## Features

- User authentication with session persistence
- Protected routes with middleware
- Product management dashboard
- Advanced filtering capabilities
  - Date range filter
  - Category multi-select filter

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Production Deployment

The deployment process involves several steps:

1. **Build the Application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up production database connections
   - Configure SSL certificates

3. **Deployment Options**
   - **Static Hosting (JAMstack)**
     - Generate static files: `npm run generate`
     - Deploy to platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or CloudFlare Pages
   
   - **Server Deployment**
     - Use PM2 or similar process manager
     - Set up Nginx as reverse proxy
     - Configure SSL with Let's Encrypt
     - Set up monitoring and logging

4. **Post-Deployment**
   - Run smoke tests
   - Monitor application performance
   - Set up error tracking
   - Configure backups

## Implementation Details

1. **Authentication**
   - Uses Pinia store for state management
   - Implements session persistence with localStorage
   - Protected routes with navigation guards

2. **Data Management**
   - Centralized state management with Pinia
   - Type-safe data structures with TypeScript
   - Efficient filtering mechanisms

3. **UI/UX**
   - Responsive design with SASS
   - Component-based architecture
   - Consistent error handling
   - Loading states and feedback

## Security Considerations

- Protected routes with middleware
- Session management
- Input validation
- XSS protection through Vue's template syntax
- CSRF protection
